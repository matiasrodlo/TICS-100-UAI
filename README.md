# TICS-100 Programming @ Universidad Adolfo Ibáñez

## Course Overview

This course is designed in two phases to develop students' programming and problem-solving skills:

1. **Problem-Solving and Abstraction Phase**
   - Focuses on developing abstraction skills in problem-solving using natural language
   - Helps students develop structured and clear thinking
   - Emphasizes identifying edge cases and repetitive conditions
   - Requires dedicated time for discussion and analysis to define problem-solving phases

2. **Programming Implementation Phase**
   - Transfers knowledge to a formal programming language (Python)
   - Enables computer execution of well-defined, structured problems
   - Provides hands-on experience with real-world programming scenarios
